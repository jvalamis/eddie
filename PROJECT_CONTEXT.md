# Eddie - Project Mission

## **Core Mission**

Transform websites into **modern Flutter apps** with beautiful UI, focusing on the **content and message** the user wants to convey, not the old styling.

## **What We Extract (Content Only)**

- ✅ **Text content** - headings, paragraphs, lists (the actual message)
- ✅ **Images** - photos, graphics, logos (part of the content/message)
- ❌ **CSS files** - we're rebuilding with Flutter's modern styling
- ❌ **JavaScript** - we're rebuilding with Flutter's functionality
- ❌ **Fonts, styling assets** - not content, just implementation details

## **Why This Approach**

- **Old websites have shit styling** - we don't want that
- **We want the pure content** - the message the user is trying to send
- **Flutter creates beautiful modern UI** - Material Design 3, responsive, cross-platform
- **Focus on content, not implementation** - CSS/JS are just old implementation details

## **The Process**

1. **Extract** website content to JSON (text + images only)
2. **Create** GitHub repository with Flutter template
3. **Deploy** via GitHub Actions (builds Flutter app)
4. **Result** - Live Flutter app with modern UI

## **Key Principle**

**Content over styling** - Extract the message, rebuild with beautiful Flutter UI
